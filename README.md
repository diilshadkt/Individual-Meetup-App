# description
  
A basic app with a login feature that uses a form submission and an easy-to-use interface.

 1. Architecture              -MVC
 2. Router                        -Default Navigator
 3. State Management   - Riverpod
 
 ## Note
   
Sometimes, when trying to log in to the API, an error occurs, but other times it works fine.

To execute the code there are riverpod and freezed files that must be generated. To build them run "**flutter pub run build_runner build**" in your terminal.
